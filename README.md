# Hello there 🤓, my name is Anton Manolov

 

I started coding almost as a joke, but that changed very quickly. From simple interest, Python turned into an informational abyss that still attracts me irresistibly, to this very day.

After several failed attempts at different languages for month or two, and  a lot of research, I became interested in Python. I watched online videos for a few months until I took the plunge and signed up for SoftUni programming basics. It was splendid! I loved Python!

Long story short - I got all in with the web development path. With each subsequent course, over almost two years, I realized how much more there was to learn. 😃 But the flame of knowledge burned brighter and brighter. I became interested in more languages and front-end in particular❤️‍🔥

So we're at this point where I start looking for a real job, while polishing my skill. I am keen to show what I've learned so far and just start building on this wonderful knowledge I got from SoftUni, and all other sources. 
I am very hopeful and looking forward to work on real projects and keep going up - to the sky. 🦸‍♂️



- 🔭 I’m currently working on The Odin Project, CS50x, CS50AI, portfolio site, and sharpening my codding skills += adding more programming tools in my arsenal.

- 🌱 Learning and exercising algorithms(LeetCode here I come!). It has been very hard to get a grasp on, but I am getting better!

- 🦗 Real job experience +1000xp! I landed an internship in Immedis from October to November 2023. The project is currently here, and I am continuing working on it! I am  very proud of how it's turning out and eager to finish it!
