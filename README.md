# Hello there ðŸ¤“ my name is Anton Manolov,
 
I started coding almost as a joke, but that changed very quickly. From simple interest, Python turned into an informational abyss that still attracts me irresistibly to this day.
Before Python, I made several failed attempts to like JavaScript, and after a lot of research, I became interested in Python. I watched online videos for a few months until I took the plunge and signed up for SoftUni.
I went all the way through the web development path with Python, with each subsequent course I realized how much more there was to learn, but the flame of knowledge burned brighter and brighter.
So to this point where I start looking for a real job where I can show what I've learned so far and just start building on this wonderful knowledge I got from SoftUni and all other known and unknown sources.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my blog project, the Pokemon game for my portfolio and sharpening my Python skills
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and exercising algorithms, this is been very hard to get a grasp on, but I am getting better!
