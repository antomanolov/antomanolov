# Hello there 🤓, my name is Anton Manolov.

 

I started coding almost as a joke, but that changed very quickly. From simple interest, Python turned into an informational abyss that still attracts me irresistibly, to this very day.

After several failed attempts to like JavaScript, and  a lot of research, I became interested in Python. I watched online videos for a few months until I took the plunge and signed up for SoftUni programming basics. It was splendid! I loved Python!

Long story short - I got all in with the web development path. With each subsequent course, over almost two years, I realized how much more there was to learn. 😃 But the flame of knowledge burned brighter and brighter. ❤️‍🔥

So we're at this point where I start looking for a real job where I can show what I've learned so far and just start building on this wonderful knowledge I got from SoftUni, and all other sources. 
I am very hopeful and looking forward to work on real projects and keep going up - to the sky. 🦸‍♂️



- 🔭 I’m currently working on my blog project, the Pokemon game for my portfolio and sharpening my Python skills

- 🌱 I’m currently learning and exercising algorithms. It has been very hard to get a grasp on, but I am getting better!
